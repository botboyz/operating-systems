One operating system function is to work on converting the keyboard types into readable text on the screen. It converts from binary to easier to read language like english.
Another operating system function is the sound card and projecting the sound data to a presentable sound for all others to hear. The speakers are a cool hardware connection for the software.
The last operating system function that i want to talk about is keeping apps efficient. The internal pieces help to delegate and efficiently use space on the computer.
